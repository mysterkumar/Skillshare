Follow these steps to get your Expo app up and running:

## Installation Instructions

1. **Create a New Expo App**
   ```bash
   npx create-expo-app --template blank appname
   ```
2. **Copy Repository Files**
   Copy the files from this repository into your new Expo app directory.

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the App**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Notes

- Each time you create an Expo app, device-specific Expo files are generated.
- The best practice is to create a blank app, install dependencies, and then add the files from the repository.
